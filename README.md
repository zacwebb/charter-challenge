# Charter Challenge

Deployed on Vercel: https://charter-challenge-phi.vercel.app/

## Getting Started

```
pnpm dev
# or an equivalent
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000

## Notes
- Current auto-layout approach isn't fantastic, but somewhat works
- Wasn't too sure on the functionality of `connection_type` and `directional` in the `interfaces_with`. I've left them as just free-form fields
